                Uranus is the seventh planet discovered in the Solar System that also led to the discovery of the last planet, Neptune they are both referred to as ice giants. Officially recognized in 1781 after many observations in the past, it is the third-largest planet of the Solar System.

                Though it is visible to the naked eye, Uranus escaped clear classification for decades. Generally mistaken for a star, it is speculated that Hipparchos might have recorded it first in 128 BC in his star catalogue. Later it was incorporated into Ptolemy’s Almagest.
            </p>
            <p>
                It takes Uranus about 7 years to pass through each zodiac constellation, and a total of 84 years to make a complete trip around the sun. Its interesting orbing caught the attention of astronomers because the planet escaped its predicted location, and thus it led to the discovery of the last planet in 1846 that would later be called Neptune.
