                Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest planet in the Solar System 
                with the highest density. <br>It is currently the only known location where life is present.

                The atmospheric greenhouse kept the oceans from freezing when the newly formed Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. <br>
                When the Earth’s magnetic field was established it helped to prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.

                The Earth makes a complete rotation on its axis once every 23.9 hours. It takes Earth 265,25 days to complete one trip around the Sun – year. 
                In order for calendars to maintain their <br>consistency with this orbit, every 4 years one day is added – this is called a leap day – as well as a leap year.
